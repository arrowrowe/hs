# Hs

A very limited HTTP server.

## History

Not intended to write this... Just want a minified one to handle incoming webhooks.

But then I turn to existing libraries... and leave this half done here.

May anyone find some inspiration in this.

## Sample

Run `npm start` to see. This sample does not show all features.

## Features

- Return a promise or a value.
- Throw `new ShouldContinueError` to hand to a next handler.
- Maybe some more...
